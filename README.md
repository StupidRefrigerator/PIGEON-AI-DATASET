# PIGEON-AI

Pigeon AI helps government infrastructure planners decide where to place new public infrastructure, starting with public toilets in Greater Sydney.

A planner gives an area, radius, infrastructure type and budget. An ML model scores each part of the city, and an LLM turns those scores into location recommendations with plain-text justifications.

## Structure

src/         Python package (pigeon_ai)
scripts/     Command-line entry points
notebooks/   Exploration and visualisation
```

## Setup

```sh
python3.14 -m venv .venv

## Docs

- [data/README.md](data/README.md): how the dataset is built, its columns and its assumptions.
- [DATA.md](DATA.md): getting the raw data from Google Drive.

The final dataset, `data/processed/sydney_hex_features.csv`, is committed. You don't need raw data to work on the model.
